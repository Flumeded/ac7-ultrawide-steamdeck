# Ace Combat 7 Resolution Fix for the Steam Deck and Linux

This mod adapts Ace Combat 7 (AC7) to work seamlessly with Steam Deck resolutions. This fork provides configuration automation, making installation and setup as easy as possible.

It enables you to patch the game without needing a mouse, keyboard, or Windows.

It will also work with any regular Linux installation.  
Just make sure [protontriks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) is installed.
Required resolution will be retrieved automatically during installation.

For more details, refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/massimilianodelliubaldini/ac7-ultrawide).
